This is the oxygen-gtk TODO list, maintained and updated by the devs.
You can add anything you can think of here. Possibly specifying the branch, a possible release target, and a priority.
You can also add your name on which of the item you are either already working on, or interested in working on.

Reminder: fixing existing bugs on bugs.kde.org should always have the highest priority :)

Try find a way to avoid flicker on combobox resize (not sure whether this actually is possible or not).

- add hooks at widget realization for registration to the relevant engines, rather than having it scattered in stylewrapper
TRIED, but it actually does not unclutter the code much, and creates other issues. So post-poned.

- better support for using oxygen-gtk in a non-kde environment.

GTK3 branch:

Arrows: DONE.
scrollbars: DONE
menus: DONE.
Slider trough: DONE
Splitter handles: DONE

Toolbar grips: DONE (but untested)

ProgressBars: DONE
But still needs to implement text color change

treeviews: DONE
But there is a problem with background in header buttons. Fixed.
There is also a problem in rendering buttons in cells (because of how header buttons are detected.) This is also true for Gtk2

TreeView selection: DONE.
Spin buttons: DONE

Menu Expander: no selection. DONE.
Icons: customize hover effect, and implement custom disable effect. DONE.

Menus: DONE, but:
- issues with scrollbar background
- tearoff menus are totally broken. Part of it might be gtk3 issue. 
- XShape not yet used for non-composited WM case (same for combobox popups and tooltips). DONE.

Comboboxes dropdown lists: shadow shouldn't look like usual focus/hover - should instead have float frame on background gradient: DONE
ComboBox resize: apparently this is not working (unlike for gtk2). The window is moved properly, but its width is not changed. FIXED
No need for resize hook any more. Use asymetric margins and mask out the sides. TODO: check if it doesn't get broken by scrollable popups

Combobox entry: completly broken.
Seems like gtk3 bug. Also broken with Raleigh. 
TODO: file bug report. DONE.
Implemented workaround in the meanwhile.

Notebooks: DONE, but vertical positionning of text in tabs is broken. 
Might also be gtk3 bug, but needs investigation.

try remapping icons using GtkStockIcon directly, rather than gtkrc, seems it is not available for gtk3.  DONE

- backport to master and 1.0, the use of gtksettings in oxygenqtsettings, in place of addToHeaderSection. 
Should be more robust. DONE
- try backport icon remapping too.

- Use as much of gtk_theming_engine_has_class, rather than gtk_widget_path_it_type.
- in gtk.css: same thing. Try use Style_classes rather than widget types.
Look at gtkcssprovider.c for examples

- fix checkbox hover in trees. Need to tag the current column being hovered, and not only the full-row. DONE.

- widget alignments:
For the moment ComboBoxes are too high (by one pixel)

Gtk3-Demo -> offscreen pixmap -> effects crashes. FIXED

Inner shadows:
Implement separate check if a particular GtkScrolledWindow has to be registered to ScrolledWindowEngine to allow for checking before registration (in innerShadowHook as well as in draw_shadow())
Also use composited child hack to round combobox list (and remove old XShape hack for this)

Apply XShape to GtkEntry and GtkComboboxEntry to make it look better on non-oxygen background (e.g. in GtkTextView)
